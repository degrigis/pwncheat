# WHAT'S THIS
Adds symbols to an ELF file. Sort of the opposite of strip.

# TO SETUP 
git clone https://github.com/wapiflapi/wsym


# TO USE 
python wsym.py -f ./symbols ./binary.bin ./binary_sym.bin
    # -f read the symbols from a file formatted in this way:
    # 
    # 000000012c symbol_name 
    # 000000055b symbol_name2 

python wsym.py -i ./symbols.map ./binary.bin ./binary_sym.bin
    # -i read the symbols from an IDA .map file ( local and segments )
    # to export the .map from IDA:
    # File -> Produce -> .MAP file
